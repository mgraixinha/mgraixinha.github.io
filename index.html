         <center>20nine is a creative brand agency located in Center City, Philadelphia. While exploring their site I have a strong feeling that it matches their associates personalities perfectly. 
         <center>I really enjoy how bright and complimentary their colors are on their home screen but once scrolling over the "About Me" description a slight shadow hovers over with options to view their other work.</center> 
         <center>Viewers can still see their original homescreen in the background while being slightly persuaded to check out just what they've done. 
         From a designers point of view attracting clients with eyecatching colors or prints is crucial; as is a similar priority from an Advertising aspect. Overall their style is appealing and beautiful.</center>
